STM32 FreeRTOS Semaphore Example
This project demonstrates the use of FreeRTOS with STM32 for basic semaphore synchronization between tasks. It includes two tasks, a sender task that gives a semaphore and a receiver task that takes the semaphore to perform some processing. The communication between tasks is handled via a binary semaphore.

Features
FreeRTOS for task management and synchronization.
Semaphore synchronization between two tasks.
UART communication for debug messages.
STM32 HAL for peripheral initialization.
Requirements
STM32F4 series microcontroller (or compatible).
STM32CubeIDE (or STM32CubeMX and a separate IDE).
FreeRTOS library.
UART-enabled terminal for displaying debug messages.
Getting Started
Hardware Setup
STM32 Microcontroller:

The STM32F4 board should be connected with a UART interface (USART2 in this case) for debugging output.
Ensure that the required hardware for UART communication is set up, including the necessary pins for TX/RX.
Connect Debug Terminal:

Use a terminal emulator (e.g., PuTTY, Tera Term) to view the output of the program via the UART interface at 115200 baud rate.
Software Setup
Clone or Download the Repository: Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.

bash

Edit
git clone <repository_url>
Open in STM32CubeIDE: Open the project in STM32CubeIDE.

Configure FreeRTOS: Ensure that FreeRTOS is properly set up in the CubeMX settings for task management and synchronization.

Build and Flash:

Build the project in STM32CubeIDE.
Flash the firmware onto the STM32 microcontroller using the debugger (e.g., ST-Link).

Code Explanation
FreeRTOS Semaphore:

A binary semaphore (xSemaphore) is created using xSemaphoreCreateBinary().
Sender Task: The sender task periodically gives the semaphore to signal the receiver task.
Receiver Task: The receiver task waits for the semaphore using xSemaphoreTake() and processes data once the semaphore is taken.
UART Debugging:

UART is initialized on USART2 for output using HAL_UART_Init().
The printf function is redirected to UART using the _write function to print debug messages.
System Clock and GPIO Initialization:

System clock and GPIO initialization is done using STM32 HAL functions (HAL_RCC_OscConfig, HAL_RCC_ClockConfig, MX_GPIO_Init).
Example Output
Once the code is running, you should see debug messages on the UART terminal, like:

sender task: giving the semaphore
Receiver Task: Semaphore taken, processing data
sender task: giving the semaphore
Receiver Task: Semaphore taken, processing data
The sender task periodically gives the semaphore every 500 ms, and the receiver task takes it to simulate processing.

Notes
This project assumes that FreeRTOS and STM32CubeIDE are correctly set up in your development environment.
The main.c file includes all necessary code for peripheral initialization, task management, and UART communication.
Error handling can be customized further depending on your specific needs.
